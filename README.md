# OrtSurSim Project

The purpose of this project is to create a CNN based model as a proof of concept for evaluating surgical skills from based solely on simulated Xray images of hip osteosynthesis.

The images were created in a simulator which is used to train and educate orthopedic surgeons. A course participant is asked to perform the surgery in the simulator and based on both behavioral and outcome results giving a score from 0-100%. For this project all behavioral contribute to the score were excluded as the score from the CNN model is based solely on the images.

The project is financed and supported by Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation (CAMES).
